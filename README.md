## Description

## Visuals

    Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video\
    (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help,\
    but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

```shell
$
```

## Usage

```

```

## Documentation

---

## Examples

You can find examples of neural networks in the [example's directory](examples).

## Support

    Tell people where they can go to for help.\
    It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap

    If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing

    State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

    For people who want to make changes to your project,\
    it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started.\
    Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set.\
    Make these steps explicit.\
    These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

    You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests.\
    These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood\
    that the changes inadvertently break something.\
    Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup,\
    such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
